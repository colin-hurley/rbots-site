<p>

I've decided I might as well make it official now that there hasn't been any development on Rbots for the past 2 years, that further development of Rbots
has currently ceased. What the JK community has managed to achieve with Rbots over the past 5 or so years should never be under-estimated and should be regarded with a deep sense of pride, especially those here at Massassi that helped make Rbots what it is. <br/><br/>

Raynar who began Rbots and saw it through its biggest challenges will ultimately be considered the one person people will first associate with it, but work done by people such as Hell Raiser and the many beta testers was always gratefully received. <br/><br/>

My role while short and which never involved coding, as I know nothing of cog bar a few simple commands, was aimed at trying to encourage the community here at Massassi to continue Raynars work. It never lasted as long as I would have wished but some notable work did come out as a result, TCNF_Merfolk's work on an adapted JK Oasis with the bots using different route nodes and more aggressive force power usage was always a blast (literally) to play, even if it was a little buggy. <br/><br/>

Goofz's series of levels, Galactic Locations was a perfect showcase of how Rbots could be added to levels and perhaps was released at the peak of Rbots development, its a shame while at University I didn't have the time to learn Cog and help improve it further. All these levels are linked to through the download page.<br/><br/>

With the close of Rbots I've changed a few things round on the site, as we no longer have our own forum, all requests for help should now be directed towards the cog forum where a wealth of knowledge is still at hand. I've also updated the screenshots section with the completed pages for the MotS section and I've gone through the whole site correcting bugs that have cropped up over the years, the site is now w3c valid.<br/><br/>

If anyone wishes to continue the work all the information needed to do so is here and available to view at anytime. All the required files are hosted here at Massassi and myself and Raynar are always contactable via our emails.<br/><br/>

Its been fun, James out.

<p>Well, its been a long while coming but i've finally got round to uploading the file sent in by TCNF_Merfolk. Its an enhanced version of Qasis full force and much faster gameplay i feel, however there are a few bugs, which i'd like everyone who downloads it to make let me know about. The file can be found <a href="files/OasisFFBots.zip">here</a>, if you have any problems/or/and find any bugs please post them <a href="http://forums.massassi.net/html/Forum6/HTML/000403.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Guess its about time I made a formal announcement about this, Midget Basher and Matt_KG are now the main guys working on the development side of Rbots, I'll be adding their names to the roster shortly. Also for those that are interested in "bot stuff" Hellcat (who has helped with Rbots in the past) is currently working on another Bot project which sounds interesting, that a look at his <a href="http://forums.massassi.net/html/Forum6/HTML/000373.html">post</a> for more info.</p>

<p>Just to let everyone who doesn't visit the forums that often of the state of the Rbots team. Midget Basher and Matt_KG have offered to help out Strike1337 with the bug fixing while C_Jedi has made progress with converting the JK:MP level Blades of Death. Emails have been sent out to confirm that everyones still interested and that we should soon be making a start. So hopefully within the next week I'll be able to confirm some new members.</p>

<p>This is the last call for anyone interested in helping out with improving Rbots, if we are unable to find at least 1 more person who is willing to help out Strike1337 it is likely I will call an end to improving Rbots, I can't expect Strike1337 to take sole responsibility for fixing the bugs. On a good note however, it is likely that there might be some new LEC converted levels on the way thanks to C_Jedi.</p>

Depending on the response we might have a new version of Rbots on the way.</p>
